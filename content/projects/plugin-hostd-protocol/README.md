# plugin-hostd-protocol

The plugin-hostd protocol, a superset of mod-host's text protocol: any mod-host client works unchanged.

`libplugin-hostd-protocol` is the socket server, the line protocol and the command dispatch that plugin-hostd and
omx-clap-host answer their controllers with. A host registers a backend (`host_backend_t`) and the library does the
rest: it listens on the command and feedback ports, splits the input into NUL-terminated commands, parses them against
the command table and answers `resp <status> [value]`, as mod-host does.

The library answers mod-host's commands as mod-host does, byte for byte, with two bugs fixed (below). Since 0.2 it also
holds the whole declared protocol: the verbs plugin-hostd and omx-clap-host add, their replies and refusals, the
events, and the one verb table and the grammar written from them (below and [doc/protocol.md](doc/protocol.md)).

## Use it

```
pkg-config --cflags --libs plugin-hostd-protocol
```

The headers are installed under `<includedir>/plugin-hostd-protocol/` with the names and the API of
`libmod-host-protocol` (`protocol.h`, `socket.h`, `host-dispatch.h`, `host-backend.h`, `host-errors.h`,
`host-scenario.h`, `mod-host.h`, `utils.h`), so a program built against `mod-host-protocol` changes only the package
name it asks pkg-config for. The scenario corpus every host is tested with, the source of its runner and the protocol
page are installed too: `pkg-config --variable=scenarios` (`runner`, `protocoldoc`) `plugin-hostd-protocol`.

The commands and the error codes: [doc/protocol.md](doc/protocol.md).

## The declared protocol

What plugin-hostd declares of the protocol is installed with the development package, so no consumer keeps a copy:

- `<plugin-hostd/protocol.h>` (under `<includedir>/plugin-hostd-protocol/`, found with this package's Cflags): the
  verbs, the placement, the reply codes, the events, the host verb table and the settings, with the headers omx-contract
  renders from `data/verbs.json` (`plugin_hostd_protocol_host_verbs.h`, `plugin_hostd_protocol_vocabulary.h`) and from
  omx-clap-core's package of the contract directory (`omx_clap_core_host_verbs.h`, `omx_clap_core_vocabulary.h`);
- the one verb table, `plugin-hostd-protocol.json`: every command, each once, with its origin (mod-host, plugin-hostd or
  omx-clap-core), its argument types, its reply and its refusals, and every feedback line
  (`pkg-config --variable=table plugin-hostd-protocol`);
- the grammar of a line, in ABNF, generated from that table (`--variable=grammar`);
- `plugin-hostd.json`, what `protocol.h` declares as JSON, and its schema (`--variable=protocoljson`,
  `--variable=protocolschema`), and `mod-host.json`, mod-host's commands and codes (`--variable=modhostjson`);
- the source of the generator of `plugin-hostd.json` (`--variable=protocolgen`), for a consumer that checks its own
  pages against a changed copy of the headers;
- `data/verbs.json`, as the package plugin-hostd-protocol of omx-contract's contract directory
  (`plugin-hostd-protocol-contract`).

Every one is written from the declarations by a tool of `tools/`, and `make check-generated` fails when one is not what
its tool writes. A word added to the protocol never changes a mod-host word: `tools/protocol-table.py` refuses to write
the table when a verb of another origin neither extends mod-host's command of the same word nor is a second form of it
told apart by its number of arguments (`preset_show <uri>` is mod-host's, `preset_show <instance> <key>` plugin-hostd's).
There is no list of exceptions.

Packages: `plugin-hostd-protocol`, `plugin-hostd-protocol-devel` and `plugin-hostd-protocol-contract` (RPM),
`libplugin-hostd-protocol0`, `libplugin-hostd-protocol-dev` and `plugin-hostd-protocol-contract` (DEB). The library
package carries the table, the grammar and the JSON documents a program reads at run time; the development package the
headers, the schema, the scenario corpus and its runner, the protocol page and the generator's source.

## Build and test

```
make
make test
make install PREFIX=/usr LIBDIR=/usr/lib64
```

`make test` needs gcc with AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (libasan, libubsan), python3 and
omx-contract's C headers (omx-contract-devel, libomx-contract-dev). It runs:

- the protocol, dispatcher and scenario tests over a fake backend (`test-protocol`, `test-protocol-commands`), and the
  input splitter, NUL framing and bind address tests (`test-utils`, `test-socket`, `test-bind`);
- the golden test (`test-golden`): the scenario corpus and both fuzz seed corpora sent over a real socket, each command
  answered nine ways by a recording backend, the transcript held byte for byte to `tests/golden/plugin-hostd-protocol.txt`;
- the comparison with mod-host (`test-golden-modhost`): every exchange of `tests/golden/mod-host-protocol.txt`, the
  same transcript taken from libmod-host-protocol 0.10.6-11.3, is the same in ours, except the ones
  `tests/golden/deviations.txt` names, which must differ. `make golden-modhost MODHOST_PREFIX=<dir>` takes it again
  from a libmod-host-protocol installed there;
- the fixes below (`test-fixes`), and each fix taken out again, which must fail (`test-fixes-sabotage`);
- the installed library as a consumer meets it (`test-install`), the exported symbols (`test-abi`, the list of
  libmod-host-protocol.so.0) and the version (`version-check`);
- the declared protocol: every generated file is what its tool writes from the declarations (`check-generated`,
  `check-protocol-doc`; `make gen` writes them), the host verb table covers every verb (`test-verb-table`),
  `mod-host.json` follows its headers (`test-mod-host-json`), and each generated file edited by hand, or each
  declaration changed without writing them again, turns those checks red (`test-generated-sabotage`), and so does each
  rule of the host verb table broken in a scratch copy of the header.

`make check-protocol-tools` runs what needs tools a package build does not carry, as CI does: the rendered headers
against the installed omx-contract and omx-clap-core-contract (`check-rendered`, and `test-rendered-sabotage`), the
staged contract package (`check-contract-dir`), the JSON against its schema (`check-schema`, python3-jsonschema), and
the grammar against the scenario corpus, the golden transcript and the table (`test-grammar`, python's `abnf` module,
`PYTHON=<an interpreter that has it>`), each with its sabotage.

`make fuzz` and `make fuzz-run` build and run the libFuzzer harnesses with clang ([fuzz/README.md](fuzz/README.md)).

## What differs from mod-host

- `format_number()` writes NaN, Infinity and -Infinity, where it wrote past a stack array: `param_info` of a port whose
  range or default is not finite (plugin-hostd#371).
- `protocol_parse()` runs the callback of the command the message names, and no other: `zzz %s 5` is not found, where
  it ran `add` (plugin-hostd#372).
- A verb may have more than one form, told apart by its number of arguments (`preset_show <uri>` is mod-host's,
  `preset_show <instance> <key>` plugin-hostd's): `protocol_parse()` reads every command registered for the verb and
  runs the first whose arguments fit, in number and then in types (`%i` a whole number, `%f` a number), where it read
  only the first one registered. A line no form takes is refused as the first form refuses it, so a verb of one form
  answers as mod-host answers it (`make test-forms`, and `test-forms-sabotage` puts the first-form reading back).

## Credit

The library's code (`src/`, the headers at the top of `include/`) is mod-host's
([mod-audio/mod-host](https://github.com/mod-audio/mod-host)), by Filipe Coelho, MOD Audio UG and the mod-host
contributors, taken from FreeMixer's fork ([FreeMixer/mod-host](https://github.com/FreeMixer/mod-host), branch
`freemixer`, 013ac7d): upstream 12335c2 with the pull requests that made it a library (#81, #82, #98, #100, #101, #104
to #109, #112, #113, #116 and the bind address of FreeMixer/mod-host#12). The files that come from it keep mod-host's
copyright and licence lines. The declared protocol (`include/plugin-hostd/`, `data/`, `protocol/`, `grammar/`,
`tools/`) came from plugin-hostd.
