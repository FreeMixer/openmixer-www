            A segment is one REAC wire — REAC A, REAC B and so on, listed with the patch name
            of what is on it. Everything else the card shows is observation: what is mastering
            it, at what pace, which link is up, which box model and firmware answered, whether
            there is a conflict. Two fields are yours: the
            <span class="text-ink">rate</span> and the <span class="text-ink">role</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            A field you never set stays unset, and an unset field leaves the daemon’s own best
            default standing — which is not the same as choosing it. The one exception is the
            role, which behaves as automatic until you say otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both picks are staged rather than sent as you scroll. You choose, then confirm, and
            the confirmation says what it will cost: changing a role re-establishes the segment
            on the wire, a few seconds of interruption. Changing the rate is worse — about six
            seconds while the box re-locks, and on a box carrying the PA return that is the
            whole rig.

            masters the segment, drives the stageboxes on it, and owns the wire’s pace — which
            is why the rate is only yours to set in this role.

          <p>
            <span class="text-ink">Recorder.</span> The console presents as the box end and
            joins a wire another desk is mastering, to take a feed off it. It asserts no pace of
            its own and follows the foreign desk physically.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="text-ink">Automatic.</span> The default. The console reads the segment
            first and then takes whichever end is open: a wire with nothing mastering it, or one
            it is already mastering, it takes as the mixer; a wire a foreign desk is mastering,
            it joins as the recorder. Unplugging a desk and having the console pick the boxes up
            is automatic doing its job.
          </p>
          <p>
            Automatic never asserts against a foreign master. A desk is joined, not fought — one
            master per segment is REAC’s law, not a policy of this console’s. If a stagebox is
            mastering the wire, or if the console cannot tell what is, it asserts nothing at all
            and tells you why.

            The word recorder does double duty on this desk. Here it means the end of a REAC
            pairing the console presents as. It has nothing to do with the multitrack recorder
            that writes takes to disk.

          <p>
            Two facts, both published by the wire: whether the segment has a master and whether
            it is ours, and — when it is not ours — whether the thing mastering it is a desk, a
            stagebox, or something the console cannot identify. That is the whole input.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not a timer. Every segment resolves when it announces itself, so a decision
            follows the wire rather than a clock: a desk that arrives after the console has
            taken a segment is seen on its next announce and automatic re-resolves against it.
            A slow desk costs one re-resolution and never a fight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Automatic runs on every segment the console can see, including ones you have never
            touched — a fresh console does not sit inert on a wire waiting to be told once.
          </p>
          <p>
            The console re-asserts what you asked for, never what it worked out. Leaving a
            segment on automatic keeps it on automatic: an observation that changes cannot
            quietly write a fixed role into your show.
          </p>
          <p>
            The card shows the daemon’s own answer beside the role you picked —
            <span class="text-ink">Applied</span>,
            <span class="text-ink">Re-establishing…</span>, or
            <span class="text-ink">Hunting for a desk…</span>. A recorder waiting on a desk that
            is not there reads as hunting and never as applied, which is the honest answer.

            A segment following a foreign desk has no rate to set: it follows that desk’s pace,
            physically. The console refuses a rate write on such a segment rather than accepting
            one it cannot honour, and the panel says so —
            <span class="text-ink">a slave segment has no rate to set — it follows the foreign
            master’s pace</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The gate is on what the segment is running now, not on what you intend it to become.
            Promoting a segment to mixer and setting its rate is therefore two confirmations,
            not one: take the wire first, then set the pace on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            A rate the segment does not publish as drivable is refused too, naming the rates it
            will take. It is never quietly rounded to the nearest one it likes.

              A rate control that hides itself on a following segment. The panel decides whether
